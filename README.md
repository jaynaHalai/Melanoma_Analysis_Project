# Melanoma_Analysis_Project

**Background**

- Data looks into the effectiveness of melanoma treatment 
- The data consists of measurements made on patients with malignant melanoma. 

- Each patient had their tumour removed by surgery at the Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of Odense, 

- Denmark during the period 1962 to 1977. The surgery consisted of complete removal of the tumour together with about 2.5cm of the surrounding skin.
- Among the measurements taken were the tumour's thickness and whether it was ulcerated.
- These are thought to be important prognostic variables in that patients with a thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased chance of death from melanoma. 
- Patients were followed until the end of 1977.
