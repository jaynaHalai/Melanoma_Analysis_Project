# Melanoma_Analysis_Project

**Background**

- Data looks into the effectiveness of melanoma treatment 
- The data consists of measurements made on patients with malignant melanoma. 

- Each patient had their tumour removed by surgery at the Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of Odense, 

- Denmark during the period 1962 to 1977. The surgery consisted of complete removal of the tumour together with about 2.5cm of the surrounding skin.
- Among the measurements taken were the tumour's thickness and whether it was ulcerated.
- These are thought to be important prognostic variables in that patients with a thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased chance of death from melanoma. 
- Patients were followed until the end of 1977.

**Research questions** 
-Analysing factors contributing to life longevity after surviving the melanoma operation.

- What is the average survival/duration for each status category?
- Is there a difference in survival duration between males and females?
- How does age correlate with survival time?
- How does the year of operation relate to survival time?
- What is the association between tumour thickness and survival time?
- How does the presence or absence of ulcers affect survival duration?
- Is there a correlation between the status of the patient and their sex?
- How does the patient's status relate to the year of operation?
- What is the connection between the patient's status and tumour thickness?
- In what scenarios does the presence of ulcers coincide with patient survival?
- How does age differ between males and females?
- Is there a relationship between age and tumour thickness?
- How does age relate to the presence of ulcers?
- What is the correlation between the year of operation and tumour thickness?
- How does the year of operation relate to the presence of ulcers?
